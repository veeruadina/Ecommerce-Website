# Introduction
The Ecommerce website is built using modern web technologies,using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development, PHP for back-end handling, and MySQL for the database. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of building an interactive online store that empowers vendors to manage products and allows customers to browse, add items to their cart, place orders, and make secure payments.

## Overview

Our goal is to create a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for customers while providing vendors with the tools to manage their product inventory efficiently. Here's an overview of the key functionalities we'll be implementing:

### Vendor-Specific Functionalities

1. **Vendor Registration and Login**: Vendors can register accounts or log in if they already have one. A dashboard will be provided for managing products and orders.

2. **Add/Edit/Delete Products**: Vendors will be able to add new products to their store, edit existing product details, and remove products that are no longer available.

### Customer-Specific Functionalities

1. **Customer Registration and Login**: Customer can register accounts or log in if they already have one. A dashboard will be provided for viewing products.
  
2. **Customer Browsing**: Customers can browse the product catalog, view individual product details, and read customer reviews.

3. **Shopping Cart**: Customers can add products to their shopping cart, view cart contents, update quantities, and remove items.

4. **Checkout Process**: Customers can proceed to checkout, enter shipping details, and then proceed to the payment page.


## Technology Stack

Before we dive into the implementation, let's review the technology stack we'll be using:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Back-end: PHP for server-side logic.
- Database: MySQL for storing product data, customer information, and orders.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

1. **Project Setup**: Create a new directory for your project and set up the necessary file structure. Create separate folders for Customer, Vendor and Shared directory for common files.

2. **Database Design**: Plan the database schema to store information about products, customers, orders, etc. Use MySQL to create the required tables.

3. **Backend Development**: Implement PHP scripts to handle user authentication, product management, and order processing.

4. **Frontend Development**: Design the user interface using HTML and CSS. Add interactivity with JavaScript to create a smooth user experience.

5. **Vendor Dashboard**: Create a dedicated dashboard for vendors to manage their products and orders. Secure this section with proper authentication.

6. **Product Listing Page**: Build a page to display all products available on the website. Implement search functionality for ease of use.

7. **Product Details Page**: Create a product details page that shows comprehensive information about each product.

8. **Shopping Cart**: Implement a shopping cart feature that allows customers to add and remove items. Display the cart contents at the checkout.

9. **Checkout Process**: Develop a multi-step checkout process, starting with shipping details and ending with payment confirmation.

10. **Order Confirmation**: Show customers an order confirmation page with details after a successful purchase.
